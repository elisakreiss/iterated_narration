In late December 2017, a couple in Iowa checked on their 50 beehives when they discovered a tragic incident. The hives had been overturned and hacked apart, the equipment had been thrown out of the shed and smashed. This destruction caused the death of half a million bees and approximately $60,000 in property damage. Nearly three weeks later, two boys (12 and 13 years old) were arrested who are allegedly responsible for the damage. The charges against them include criminal mischief, offenses to an agricultural animal facility, and burglary. Since they are still minors, they'll be charged in juvenile court where they face up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $10,000 if convicted.
