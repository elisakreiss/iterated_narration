Customs officials in Kuwait caught a homing pigeon that wore a small backpack stuffed with illegal drugs. According to two officials, they found 178 pills containing a form of ketamine. The pigeon was captured close to the Iraq-Kuwait border. A journalist told the BBC that it was already known to the officials that smugglers used pigeons to distribute drugs, but this is the first bird that they were able to catch.
This is not a new method to transport drugs. In 2011, the police in Columbia had caught a pigeon waering a bag that contained marijuana and cocaine from a failed attempt to smuggle the drugs into prison. The plan presumably failed because the bag was too heavy and the pigeon was therefore not able to fly over the prison walls.
