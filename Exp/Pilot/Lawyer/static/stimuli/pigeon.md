Customs officials in Kuwait caught a homing pigeon that was wearing a small backpack stuffed with illegal drugs. According to two officials, they found 178 pills that contained a form of ketamine. The pigeon was captured close to the Iraq-Kuwait border. A journalist told the BBC that it was already known to officials that smugglers use pigeons to distribute drugs, but this is the first bird that they were able to catch. This is not a new method to transport drugs. In 2011, the police in Colombia caught a pigeon wearing a bag that contained marijuana and cocaine from a failed attempt to smuggle the drugs into prison. The plan presumably failed because the bag was too heavy and the pigeon was therefore not able to fly over the prison walls.
