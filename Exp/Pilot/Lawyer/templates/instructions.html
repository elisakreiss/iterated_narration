        <p>In this experiment you will read short stories. You are asked to reproduce these stories as best as you can for a particular purpose which will be introduced next. It is absolutely vital that you do not take notes when reading the stories which need to be reproduced and that you write down your reproduction in a focused and concentrated manner immediately after reading the original story.</p>

            <p>Imagine you are an intern in a <strong>lawyer’s office</strong>. Your boss likes to stay up-to-date about potentially interesting or groundbreaking cases. Your task is to go through crime reports and brief your boss on the contents. Please don’t take notes!.</p>

            <!-- <p>Imagine you are at a <strong>friend’s birthday party</strong> and your friend suggests playing a game called “Story Time”. Everyone gets crime reports of real events and needs to retell the story in the most entertaining way possible. After every round, everyone votes for the best storyteller, who then receives a point. The person with the most points wins the game. Please don’t take notes!</p> -->

            <!-- <p>In this experiment, you will read crime reports of real events. Your task is to read these reports carefully and then retell them as accurately as possible. Please don’t take notes!</p> -->
