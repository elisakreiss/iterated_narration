Germany. On Midday Janurary 1, 2018, a couple returned from a New Year’s Eve party. When they arrived at their home, they found it to be violently opened and they immediately contacted the police. When the police officers examined the house, they found a man sleeping at the bottom of the stairs with the stolen goods still in his pockets. He was then woken up by the police and tried to escape. According to a police spokesman, the 38 year old man could be captured and brought to the police department. His nap probably won’t stay without consequences: The police have instituted criminal proceedings against him for burglary.
