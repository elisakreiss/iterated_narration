    <p>Imagine you are an apprentice in a <strong>lawyer’s office</strong>. Lately, your boss doesn’t have a lot of clients and is looking for possible cases. It is your task to go through interesting reports and inform your boss about what you’ve read.</p>

    <!-- <p>Imagine you are at a friend’s birthday party and your friend just suggested to play a game called “Storytime”. Everyone gets crime reports about real events and needs to tell the story in the most entertaining way possible. After every round, each person votes for the best storyteller who then receives a point. The person with the most points wins the game.</p> -->

    <!-- <p>In this experiment, you are given crime reports from actual events. Your task is to read these reports carefully and then reproduce them.</p> -->
