# Influences of Pragmatics on Iterated Narration

In a between-subjects design, we study how chains of Iterated Reproduction of stories (e.g., Bartlett 1932, Allport & Postman 1947) may be influenced by the pragmatic purpose of reproduction. Iterated Reproduction chains start with one out of __N seeds__, i.e., stories composed of existing text material describing (anonymized) actual events, such as from newspapers or reports. Seeds cover potentially scandalous events, such as sexual harassment, fraud, blackmailing, manipulation etc. Participants in a single chain initially read a seed story and are then told to reproduce it for some pragmatic purpose. The reproduction they produce will be the story for the next generation of participants, and so on for __M generations__. Each seed will be fed into __K parallel iterated reproduction chains__.

One group of participants is told to reproduce the relevant facts as faithfully as possible using a __cover story__ that the participant is an apprentice in a lawyer’s office who needs to retell the story to their boss. A second group of participants operates on a cover story according to which the participant hears the story at a social meeting (a party) and later retells the story to a different group of people at another informal gathering of friends. The second group is not told to be faithful but rather to try to be entertaining and to capture their audiences’ attention. A third group functions as a control group. They only receive the neutral instruction to retell the story without giving any specific context information.

We are interested in comparing several __dependent measures__ in their temporal development and over the between-subject manipulation of pragmatic purpose. Every story of every chain is presented to an independent pool of L experimental participants who given __subjective judgments__ along several dimensions. For example, we could ask:

- Based on the story you have read, how likely do you think MAIN CHARACTER would be convicted for NAME-OF-OFFENSE if the case was brought to trial?
- Based on the story you have read, how sympathetic do you find MAIN CHARACTER?
- Based on the story you have read, how strongly would you support that MAIN CHARACTER should be fired from her/his job?
- ...

Additionally, we will collect a number of __objective variables__ for each story which are interesting from a linguistic point of view. For example, we could look at:

- The number of uncertainty markers, i.e., words or constructions that show that the story-teller is uncertain about some factual information, like probably, about five times or so, etc.
- The number of expressives, i.e., words or constructions that signal speaker-evaluation, like fucking, bloody, an insane amount etc.
- Use of intensifiers.
- The number of repetitions of factual information.
- Choice of lexical material (emotional content, strength (touching vs groping).
- …

## General to do (roughly in order)

- Construct seeds
- Write cover stories
- Implement Iterated Reproduction experiment (in Dallinger, using the Bartlett demo … ?)
- Run a pilot with one or two seeds, inspect responses
- Device dependent measures based on pilot data (subjective and objective)
- Set up subjective-judgements task and, if suitable, pilot on pilot data from iterated reproduction
- Fix statistical analyses, write analysis scripts based on pilot data and its derived measures
- Pilot other seeds with small 
- Submit preregistration report
- Run full exp.

## Thoughts

- change party cover story to "telling your best friend while having dinner" to avoid crazy, exotic and completely untruthful stories

## At some point

- Fix N - number of seeds (3 -- 5)
- Fix M - number of generations
- Fix K - number of parallel chains for a given seed
- Fix L - number of subjects for subjective judgements

## Cover stories
1. Imagine you are an intern in a lawyer’s office. Your boss likes to stay up-to-date about potentially interesting or groundbreaking cases. Your task is to go through crime reports and brief your boss on the contents. Please don’t take notes!
2. Imagine you are at a friend’s birthday party and your friend suggests playing a game called “Story Time”. Everyone gets crime reports of real events and needs to retell the story in the most entertaining way possible. After every round, everyone votes for the best storyteller, who then receives a point. The person with the most points wins the game. Please don’t take notes!
3. In this experiment, you will read crime reports of real events. Your task is to read these reports carefully and then retell them as accurately as possible. Please don’t take notes!

#### Criminals strap tiny rucksack to pigeon to smuggle drugs
Customs officials in Kuwait caught a homing pigeon that was wearing a small backpack stuffed with illegal drugs. According to two officials, they found 178 pills that contained a form of ketamine. The pigeon was captured close to the Iraq-Kuwait border. A journalist told the BBC that it was already known to officials that smugglers use pigeons to distribute drugs, but this is the first bird that they were able to catch.
This is not a new method to transport drugs. In 2011, the police in Colombia caught a pigeon wearing a bag that contained marijuana and cocaine from a failed attempt to smuggle the drugs into prison. The plan presumably failed because the bag was too heavy and the pigeon was therefore not able to fly over the prison walls.

#### Half a million bees die in Iowa vandalism, two boys charged
In late December 2017, a couple in Iowa checked on their 50 beehives when they discovered a tragic incident. The hives had been overturned and hacked apart, the equipment had been thrown out of the shed and smashed. This destruction caused the death of half a million bees and approximately $60,000 in property damage.
Nearly three weeks later, two boys (12 and 13 years old) were arrested who are allegedly responsible for the damage. The charges against them include criminal mischief, offenses to an agricultural animal facility, and burglary. Since they are still minors, they'll be charged in juvenile court where they face up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $10,000 if convicted.

#### Burglar falls asleep during burglary
On midday on January 1, 2018, a couple returned to their home from a New Year’s Eve party. When they arrived, they found that somebody had forcefully entered, and they immediately contacted the police. When the police officers examined the house, they found a man sleeping at the bottom of the stairs with the stolen goods still in his pockets. He was woken up by the police and tried to escape, but was captured and arrested. His nap probably won’t remain without consequences: The police have initiated criminal proceedings against him for burglary.

#### No Passport or Ticket: How a Woman Evaded Airport Security and Flew to London
On January 15, 2018, a woman (66 years old) without a ticket and passport slipped through airport security and took a flight from Chicago to London. 
The woman entered Chicago O’Hare International Airport on January 14. First, she hid her face with her hair and passed two Transportation Security Administration officers who were controlling other passenger’s boarding passes. After she was screened, she wanted to board a flight to Connecticut but failed. When the woman tried to sneak past the gate agent, she was stopped and directed to sit down. 
She stayed overnight at the airport and rode a shuttle bus to the international gate the next day, even though a passport and plane ticket are required to board the shuttle. She then entered a plane to Heathrow Airport (London), where she was detained by British customs officials. She arrived back in the United States on January 18. The woman is charged with theft and misdemeanor for trespassing.

#### Smugglers stuff exotic birds into pipes
In Indonesia, four men have been arrested for smuggling 125 exotic birds. The police found 41 endangered white cockatoos and 84 eclectus parrots stuffed into plastic drain pipes that were sealed at each end by a wire. The suspects were arrested in four separate locations in the Eastern part of Indonesia and are believed to be part of a wildlife trafficking ring. Those exotic birds are often illegally sold as pets and status symbols. Officials assume that the birds were meant to be transported to the Philippines. The alleged smugglers face up to five years in prison and a $7530 fine if found guilty. 

#### A German Alexa owner returned home to find his Amazon device had started a 'party' at 2am, leading to police breaking down his door
On November 8, 2017, the police received a phone call regarding an incident of nightly disturbance. Music was playing loudly in an apartment in Hamburg, Germany, from 1:30 to 3:00 in the morning. After the officers rang the door bell several times and did not receive any response, they called a locksmith to break the door open. They identified an Amazon Echo as the source of the disturbance but the owner of the apartment was not present. When he returned home from a party later that day, he was unable to enter his apartment, since the locks had been exchanged. In the police station, he was then charged a high fee for the service. Because the windows and door were closed, it still remains unclear how Alexa got activated.
