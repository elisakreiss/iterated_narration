# First Observations

## General

#### Found repeatedly / easy to determine

- reproductions become shorter
- vagueness descriptions disappear
- upper bounds become definite results
- inconclusive statements become more conclusive
- handling infrequent words
	- often omitted or circumscribed
	- sometimes people seem to unconsciously give it their own meaning (Kalama)
- direct speech disappears
- correction of typos
- author vagueness gets lost
- making use of world knowledge to add to / to disambiguate narrative
- confusion of highly associated events (shifts in meanings)
- generalizations and summarizations (becoming less specific)
- prototypical specifications (becoming more specific by filling in prototypical attributes)
- omit reasons (maybe also motives)
- singularization
- exchange cities: Chicago -> Kentucky; London -> New York

#### To think about

- side stories seem to be omitted / highly shortened
- order of narration is mainly chronological
- sentences become shorter or enumeration-like
- scene description disappears
- maybe a tendency to exaggerate
- passive becomes active with main character as agent
- main character gets heroized
- maybe highly emotional / very vivid images stay ("black coming out of his mouth")
- numbers are hard
- 2018 -> 2017

## Story specific

### Flight
- infrequent words disappear
	- misdemeanor
	- trespassing -> passing borders without permission
- correction of typos
	- Kenntuky -> Kentucky
- more specific with integration of world knowledge
	- she tried to get on a flight to Kenntuky, but failed -> but missed the flight
	- **"was not allowed to enter" was never mentioned in original**
	- "Chicago (USA)"
- confuse events that often happen together / are highly associated
	- **"controlling other passenger's boarding passes" -> "checking the luggage of other passengers"**
	- she hid "her face" -> she hid "her head"
	- **"she tried to board a flight" -> "she tried to book a flight" (happens several times)**
- initial summary sentence is often left out (most of the time, narrative is presented in chronological order -- almost always in the end)
- first attempts that are not the main story, are often shortened 
	- "the first attempt failed"
- previous author's vagueness almost never gets transferred
	- "came back to the US two or three days after" -> "She returned to America"
- generalizations/summarizations 
	- international terminal -> different terminal
	- charged with theft and misdemeanor for trespassing -> charged with two crimes/was sentenced
	- sentenced -> punished
	- 66 year old -> old
- prototypical specification
	- punished -> prisoned 
- shift in meaning
	- charged -> accused (happens several times)
- **2018 almost always switches to 2017 at some point**

### Bees
- **vagueness descriptions disappear**
	- nearly
- **upper bounds become definite results**
	- "up to 10 years in prison" -> "10 years in prison"
	- "up to $10,000" -> "$10,000"  
	- up to -> probably -> had to
- **inconclusive statements become (more) conclusive**
	- allegedly, face up to... if convicted -> "They were sentenced to"...
	- "allegedly" -> "probably"
	- they face juvenile court -> they faced juvenile court
	- suspectedly broken by -> were boken by
	- up to -> probably -> had to
- sentences become shorter or very long lists (but definitely less complex)
	- with lists, I mean "he then went there and knocked, after he saw that and..."
- **material damage (equipment) almost always gets lost**
- generalizations/summarizations
	- "overturned and hacked apart" -> destroyed
	- $10,000 -> "money fee"
	- "lost one of their 50 beehives" -> "lost their beehives"
- exaggeration
	- "approximately $60,000" -> "over $60,000"
	- half a millions bees -> millions of bees
- **problems with numbers**
	- half a millions bees -> half of the bees
	- 10 years -> 8 years / 5 years / 9 years
	- $10,000 -> $12,000
	- 12 and 13 -> 13 and 14
	- half a millions bees -> millions of bees
	- 3 weeks -> 1 week -> 1 year -> 2 years
- incorporation of world knowledge
	- were charged $10,000 "to repay the damage"
	- **"two boys were arrested, got another punishment and had to repay the damage" -> "were at fault"**
	- **a couple noticed a damage -> reported that someone broke into their property**
- and -> plus / or
