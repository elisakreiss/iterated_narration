# First Observations

### Flight
- not very interesting to us so far

### Bees
- **vagueness descriptions disappear**
	- nearly 3 weeks -> 3 weeks
	- approximately 60000 -> 60000/50000 (4 times)
	- an estimated 60000 -> 60000
- **introduction of vagueness descriptions**
	- half a million -> nearly half a million
	- 60000 -> an estimated 60000
- **upper bounds become definite results**
	- face up to -> face -> were ordered to/were criminally charged
	- fines up to -> charges of
	- up to -> could face a -> pay
	- face up to 10 years -> potentially face 10 years
- **inconclusive statements become (more) conclusive**
	- were arrested who are allegedly responsible -> were arrested -> vandalized by two kids
	- arrested allegedly responsible -> arrested -> were responsible
	- allegedly responsible -> accused of -> it was 2 boys/it was 2 adolescents
	- allegedly responsible -> found to be responsible
	- allegedly responsible -> later charged -> were responsible
	- face -> faced -> were found guilty
	- face up to -> face -> were ordered to/were criminally charged
- **exaggeration**
	- nearly half a million -> over half a million

- **and**
	- and -> and/or -> or
	- and -> or 
- other
	- half a million bees -> all bees
	- half a million bees -> most bees
