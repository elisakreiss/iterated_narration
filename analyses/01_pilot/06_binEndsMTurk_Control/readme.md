## General Notes
- there is a big difference in "if guilty" and "if found guilty"; we're not that interested in "if found guilty" but we want to manipulate their belief that the main character is in fact guilty and whether they communicate THIS uncertainty
- numbers and intensifiers are countable, but likelihood should be evaluated by people reading the text and then judging how likely they believe the main character to be at fault
- in the arson story (esp. jail), they like to enumerate things that were damaged instead of the estimate
- in the bees free story, they seem to be sure that it was the two boys and now they don't even get charged for it
- in the smuggler story, change first sentence because it already suggests that they've been rightfully arrested (maybe say "accused" instead)
- the smuggler free story included an eyewitness sentence which was not supposed to be there (this could have confused some participants)
