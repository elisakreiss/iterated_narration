"3FJshIyBYGd3qrcz","false",1,"In Iowa a couple discovered that their beehive had been completely
destroyed. This led to the loss of lives of many bees and destruction
of property. In the search for who had done it, it turned out
it was two young boys, around the age of 12. They had completely
destroyed everything and were arrested for their crimes and to
be tried as minors.","In late December 2017, a couple in Iowa checked on their 50 beehives when they discovered a tragic incident. The hives had been overturned and hacked apart, the equipment had been thrown out of the shed
and smashed. This destruction caused the death of half a million bees and approximately $60,000 in property damage. Nearly three weeks later, two boys (12 and 13 years old) were arrested who are allegedly
responsible for the damage. The charges against them include criminal mischief, offenses to an agricultural animal facility, and burglary. Since they are still minors, they'll be charged in juvenile court
where they face up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $10,000 if convicted.","bees"
"Setrwtr44tPyn6Y8","false",1,"A woman was able to fly to another country with no passport and
no flight. She snuck through Security at Chicago O'Hare. She hid
from the cameras and was able to sneak through. She tried to get
a domestic flight, but was not successful. She was also caught
by security and asked to stay. Somehow she was still able to sneak
into the international terminal. She made it all the way to the
UK before she was detained by the British authorities.","On January 15, 2018, a woman (66 years old) without a ticket and passport slipped through airport security and took a flight from Chicago to London. The woman entered Chicago O’Hare International Airport
on January 14. First, she hid her face with her hair and passed two Transportation Security Administration officers who were controlling other passenger’s boarding passes. After she was screened, she wanted
to board a flight to Connecticut but failed. When the woman tried to sneak past the gate agent, she was stopped and directed to sit down. She stayed overnight at the airport and rode a shuttle bus to the
international gate the next day, even though a passport and plane ticket are required to board the shuttle. She then entered a plane to Heathrow Airport (London), where she was detained by British customs
officials. She arrived back in the United States on January 18. The woman is charged with theft and misdemeanor for trespassing.","flight"
