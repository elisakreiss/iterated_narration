Nearly one week after discovering the illegally captured birds, the police arrested four men who purportedly attempted to commit the smuggling.

In these emails, the recipients were accused of illegally distributing pornographic content and were instructed to pay $11,500 by the end of September to avoid a lawsuit. Searching for the email address online leads to an official law firm website located in Barcelona. Shortly after the emails were sent out, the law firm disowned them, calling them a hoax. So far, police officials estimate that approximately 5% of the recipients have paid the money. This sums to more than $17 million that have been paid to the scammers. Now, nearly 4 weeks later, the police have tracked down the internet cafe from which the emails were sent. After observing the cafe's camera footage, the police arrested a man and a woman (both 52) who were allegedly responsible for the scam. If found guilty, they face up to 9 years in prison. However, news outlets recently acquired access to the camera footage and found that the video material is of very poor quality and therefore potentially unreliable.","scam_free",30.5316833333333,5,"reproduction",74
