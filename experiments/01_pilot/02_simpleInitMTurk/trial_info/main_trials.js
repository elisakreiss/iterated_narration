	text: 'One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals, and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: "Maybe this is a war-party". They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to the them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: "What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people". One of the young men said: "I have no arrows". "Arrows are in the canoe", they said. "I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you", he said, turning to the other, "may go with them." So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water, and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say: "Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit". Now he thought: "Oh, they are ghosts". He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac, and the young man went ashore to his house, and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: "Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick". He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried. He was dead.'

	text: "In late December 2017, a couple in Iowa checked on their 50 beehives when they discovered a tragic incident. The hives had been overturned and hacked apart, the equipment had been thrown out of the shed and smashed. This destruction caused the death of half a million bees and approximately $60,000 in property damage. Nearly three weeks later, two boys (12 and 13 years old) were arrested who are allegedly responsible for the damage. The charges against them include criminal mischief, offenses to an agricultural animal facility, and burglary. Since they are still minors, they'll be charged in juvenile court where they face up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $10,000 if convicted."

	text: "On January 15, 2018, a woman (66 years old) without a ticket and passport slipped through airport security and took a flight from Chicago to London. The woman entered Chicago O’Hare International Airport on January 14. First, she hid her face with her hair and passed two Transportation Security Administration officers who were controlling other passenger’s boarding passes. After she was screened, she wanted to board a flight to Connecticut but failed. When the woman tried to sneak past the gate agent, she was stopped and directed to sit down. She stayed overnight at the airport and rode a shuttle bus to the international gate the next day, even though a passport and plane ticket are required to board the shuttle. She then entered a plane to Heathrow Airport (London), where she was detained by British customs officials. She arrived back in the United States on January 18. The woman is charged with theft and misdemeanor for trespassing."
