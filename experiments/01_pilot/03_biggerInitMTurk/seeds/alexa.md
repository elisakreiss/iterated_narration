On November 8, 2017, the police received a phone call regarding an incident of nightly disturbance. Music was playing loudly in an apartment in Hamburg, Germany, from 1:30 to 3:00 in the morning. After the officers rang the door bell several times and did not receive any response, they called a locksmith to break the door open. They identified an Amazon Echo as the source of the disturbance but the owner of the apartment was not present. When he returned home from a party later that day, he was unable to enter his apartment, since the locks had been exchanged. In the police station, he was then charged a high fee for the service. Because the windows and door were closed, it still remains unclear how Alexa got activated.
