## Experiment Pilot 06\_binEndsMTurk\_Control

### Question
Do we find a different use in hedges when we reassure vs. dispirit the readers belief that the suspect is in fact responsible?
(Maybe also have third seed without final sentence to compare which version this basic one is closer to?)

### Expectations
We assume that people will come quicker to a narrative where the suspect is presented as the committer in the reassured version. In other words, we expect that likelihood expressions (probably, presumably, it is expected, allegedly) and conditionals(?) connected to their conviction (if convicted, could) vanish quicker in this case. This should also partly result in a reduction of impreciseness expressions regarding the suggested punishment (up to). <br>
We consider it a possibility that we find more exaggerations in the reassured case and maybe more emphasis on emotional arousal.

### Notes
