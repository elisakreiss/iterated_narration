Since mid-April 2018, a region in Bavaria, Germany, has faced a series of purposefully laid fires burning trash cans, a car and even an entire town house. At its peak, eight different fires were laid in just one night. Fortunately, people did not get hurt, but the material damage is estimated at around $450,000. The police could not make significant advances in finding the perpetrator, until they initiated a public search. Each person with a helpful tip was announced to be rewarded around $6000. A black shirt with a unique imprint which was found on one of the crime scenes might have given the critical clue. About a week ago, the police arrested a 37 year old suspect because of severe arson. If found guilty, he will face up to 10 years in prison.
According to recent reports, experts believe that the evidence against him is strong enough for a conviction, especially since his testimonies about his whereabouts seem to show some incongruities.
