In Indonesia, four men have been arrested for smuggling 125 exotic birds. The police found 41 endangered white cockatoos and 84 eclectus parrots stuffed into plastic drain pipes that were sealed at each end by a wire. Those exotic birds are often illegally sold as pets and status symbols. In the US, this delivery is worth approximately $250,000. Nearly one week after discovering the illegally captured animals, the police had managed to capture four men who are presumably responsible for this act. The suspects were arrested in four separate locations in the Eastern part of Indonesia and are believed to be part of a wildlife trafficking ring. Officials assume that the birds were meant to be transported to the Philippines. 
The alleged smugglers face up to five years in prison and a $7530 fine if found guilty. Indeed, it is expected that the smugglers will be charged, because the evidence against them is strong.
