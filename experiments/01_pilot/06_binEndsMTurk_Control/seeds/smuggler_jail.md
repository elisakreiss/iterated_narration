In Indonesia, four men have been arrested for smuggling about 150 exotic birds which were meant to be transported to the Philippines. The police found the animals stuffed into plastic drain pipes that were sealed at each end by a wire. In the US, this delivery is worth approximately $250,000. Those exotic birds are often illegally sold as pets and are seen as status symbols. Nearly one week after discovering the illegally captured birds, the police had managed to track down four men who are allegedly responsible for this act. According to police officials they had several eyewitness accounts which led to the arrests. The suspects face up to five years in prison and an up to $8000 fine if found guilty.
The case rests on several eyewitness reports which provide a very strong case and there have been inconsistencies in the testimonies of the four suspects. Thus, a conviction seems likely.
