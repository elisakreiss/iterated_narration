In Indonesia, four men have been arrested for smuggling about 150 exotic birds. The police found the animals stuffed into plastic drain pipes that were sealed at each end by a wire. In the US, this delivery is worth approximately $250,000. Nearly one week after discovering the illegally captured birds, the police had managed to track down four men who are allegedly responsible for this act. The suspects were arrested in four separate locations in the Eastern part of Indonesia and are believed to be part of a wildlife trafficking ring. According to police officials they had several eyewitness accounts which led to the arrests. Officials assume that the birds were meant to be transported to the Philippines. The suspects face up to five years in prison and an up to $8000 fine if found guilty.
Several inconsistencies have been found in the statements of the four suspects and as the case rests on several eyewitness reports which provide a very strong case, it is believed that they will be convicted.
