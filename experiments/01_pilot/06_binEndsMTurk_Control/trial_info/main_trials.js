		text: "In late December 2017, a couple in Iowa was checking on their 50 beehives when they discovered a tragic incident. The hives had been overturned and hacked apart and the equipment had been thrown out of the shed and smashed. This destruction caused the death of about half a million bees and approximately $60,000 in property damage. Nearly three weeks later, two boys (12 and 13 years old) who are allegedly responsible for the damage were arrested. The charges against them include criminal mischief, offenses to an agricultural animal facility, and burglary. Since they are still minors, they will be charged in juvenile court where they face up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $10,000 if convicted. However, it is expected that the two boys won't be convicted, because they still insist on their innocence and the evidence against them is weak."

Indeed, it is expected that the two boys will be convicted, because they don't have alibis for that time and the evidence against them is strong."

		text: "Since mid-April 2018, a region in Bavaria, Germany, has faced a series of purposefully set fires burning trash cans, a car and even an entire town house. At its peak, eight different fires were started in a single night. Fortunately, nobody was hurt, but the material damages were estimated at around $450,000. The police could not make significant advances in finding the perpetrator, until they publicly offered a reward of $6000 for each helpful tip. A black shirt with a unique design which was found on one of the crime scenes might have given the critical clue. About a week ago, the police arrested a 37 year old suspect on charges of severe arson. If found guilty, he will face up to 10 years in prison. According to recent reports, experts don't believe that the evidence against him is enough for a conviction, especially since he continually asserts that he did not commit those crimes."

		text: "In Indonesia, four men have been arrested for smuggling about 150 exotic birds which were meant to be transported to the Philippines. The police found the animals stuffed into plastic drain pipes that were sealed at each end by a wire. In the US, this delivery is worth approximately $250,000. Those exotic birds are often illegally sold as pets and are seen as status symbols. Nearly one week after discovering the illegally captured birds, the police had managed to track down four men who are allegedly responsible for this act. According to police officials they had several eyewitness accounts which led to the arrests. The suspects face up to five years in prison and an up to $8000 fine if found guilty. However, the case rests on an anonymous tip which provides a very weak case and all four suspects still deny any connection to the smuggling affair. Thus, a conviction seems unlikely."
