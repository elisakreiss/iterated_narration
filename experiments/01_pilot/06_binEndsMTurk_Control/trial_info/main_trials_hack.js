	text: "In late December 2017, a couple in Iowa was checking on their 50 beehives when they discovered a tragic incident. The hives had been overturned and hacked apart and the equipment had been thrown out of the shed and smashed. This destruction caused the death of half a million bees and approximately $60,000 in property damage. Nearly three weeks later, two boys (12 and 13 years old) who are allegedly responsible for the damage were arrested. The charges against them include criminal mischief, offenses to an agricultural animal facility, and burglary. Since they are still minors, they will be charged in juvenile court where they face up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $10,000 if convicted.",
	ending_free: "However, it is expected that the two boys won't be convicted, because they still insist on their innocence and the evidence against them is weak.",
	ending_jail: "Indeed, it is expected that the two boys will be convicted, because some of their statements were inconsistent and the evidence against them is strong."

	title: 'arson',
	text: "Since mid-April 2018, a region in Bavaria, Germany, has faced a series of purposefully set fires burning trash cans, a car and even an entire town house. At its peak, eight different fires were started in a single night. Fortunately, nobody was hurt, but the material damages were estimated at around $450,000. The police could not make significant advances in finding the perpetrator, until they publicly offered a reward of $6000 for each helpful tip. A black shirt with a unique design which was found on one of the crime scenes might have given the critical clue. About a week ago, the police arrested a 37 year old suspect on charges of severe arson. If found guilty, he will face up to 10 years in prison.",
	ending_free: "According to recent reports, experts don't believe that the evidence against him is enough for a conviction, especially since he continually asserts that he did not commit those crimes.",
	ending_jail: "According to recent reports, experts believe that the evidence against him is strong enough for a conviction, especially since his statements about his whereabouts seem to show some inconsistencies."

	title: 'smuggler',
	text: "In Indonesia, four men have been arrested for smuggling 125 exotic birds. The police found 41 endangered white cockatoos and 84 eclectus parrots stuffed into plastic drain pipes that were sealed at each end by a wire. Those exotic birds are often illegally sold as pets and are seen as status symbols. In the US, this delivery is worth approximately $250,000. Nearly one week after discovering the illegally captured animals, the police had managed to capture four men who are allegedly responsible for this act. The suspects were arrested in four separate locations in the Eastern part of Indonesia and are believed to be part of a wildlife trafficking ring.",
	ending_free: "According to police officials they received a clue from an anonymous caller which led to the arrests. Officials assume that the birds were meant to be transported to the Philippines. The alleged smugglers face up to five years in prison and a $7530 fine if found guilty. However, all four suspects still deny any connection to the smuggling affair and since the anonymous tip provides a very weak case, it is believed that they will be cleared of charges.",
	ending_jail: "According to police officials they had several eyewitness accounts which led to the arrests. Officials assume that the birds were meant to be transported to the Philippines. The alleged smugglers face up to five years in prison and a $7530 fine if found guilty. Several inconsistencies have been found in the statements of the four suspects and since the eyewitness accounts provide a very strong case, it is believed that they will be convicted."
