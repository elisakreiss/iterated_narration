## Experiment Pilot 07\_revised06

### Question
From 06: *Do we find a different use in hedges when we reassure vs. dispirit the reader's belief that the suspect is in fact responsible?* <br>


### Expectations
From 06: *We assume that people will come quicker to a narrative where the suspect is presented as the committer in the reassured version. In other words, we expect that likelihood expressions (probably, presumably, it is expected, allegedly) and conditionals(?) connected to their conviction (if convicted, could) vanish quicker in this case. This should also partly result in a reduction of impreciseness expressions regarding the suggested punishment (up to). We consider it a possibility that we find more exaggerations in the reassured case and maybe more emphasis on emotional arousal.* <br>
In the dispirited case, information about punishment should be left out more often, since it's perceived not as relevant, because the person is probably not actually responsible.


### Notes
- Do we now accomplish to manipulate the belief in how guilty the main character is instead of how likely a guilty plead is?
