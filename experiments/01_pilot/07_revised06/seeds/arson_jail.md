Since mid-April 2018, a region in Bavaria, Germany, has faced a series of purposefully set fires burning trash cans, a car and even an entire town house. At its peak, eight different fires were started in a single night. Fortunately, nobody was hurt, but the material damages were estimated at around $450,000. The police could not make significant advances in finding the perpetrator, until they publicly offered a reward of $6000 for each helpful tip. A black shirt with a unique design which was found on one of the crime scenes might have given the critical clue. About a week ago, the police arrested a 37 year old suspect on charges of severe arson. If found guilty, he will face up to 10 years in prison.
According to recent reports, experts don't believe that the existing evidence leaves any doubt about his guilt.
