In late December 2017, a couple in Iowa was checking on their 50 beehives when they discovered a tragic incident. The hives had been overturned and hacked apart and the equipment had been thrown out of the shed and smashed. This destruction caused the death of about half a million bees and approximately $60,000 in property damage. Nearly three weeks later, two boys (12 and 13 years old) who are allegedly responsible for the damage were arrested. The charges against them include criminal mischief, offenses to an agricultural animal facility, and burglary. Since they are still minors, they will be charged in juvenile court where they face up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $10,000 if convicted. 
But police officials explained that the investigation is still in progress, and the evidence so far doesn't allow for rushed conclusions about the guilt of the suspects.
