Because of a routine check on cargo vessel, the Indonesian police was able to prevent a smuggling attempt. They found about 150 exotic birds stuffed into plastic drain pipes that were sealed at each end by a wire. The animals were meant to be transported to the US, where they can be soled as pets. Officials assume, that the operation was planned and executed by a wildlife trafficking ring. This delivery is worth approximately $250,000. Nearly one week after discovering the illegally captured birds, the police arrested four men who are allegedly responsible for this act. The suspects face up to five years in prison and an up to $8000 fine if found guilty.
However, the case rests on several eyewitness reports which provide a very strong case and there have been inconsistencies in the testimonies of the four suspects. Thus, it is very likely, that they were involved.
