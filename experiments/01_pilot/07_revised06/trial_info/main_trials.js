		text: "In late December 2017, a couple in Iowa was checking on their 50 beehives when they discovered a tragic incident. The hives had been overturned and hacked apart and the equipment had been thrown out of the shed and smashed. This destruction caused the death of about half a million bees and approximately $60,000 in property damage. Nearly three weeks later, two boys (12 and 13 years old) who are allegedly responsible for the damage were arrested. The charges against them include criminal mischief, offenses to an agricultural animal facility, and burglary. Since they are still minors, they will be charged in juvenile court where they face up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $10,000 if convicted. But police officials explained that the investigation is still in progress, and the evidence so far doesn't allow for rushed conclusions about the guilt of the suspects."

		text: "Since mid-April 2018, a region in Bavaria, Germany, has faced a series of purposefully set fires burning trash cans, a car and even an entire town house. At its peak, eight different fires were started in a single night. Fortunately, nobody was hurt, but the material damages were estimated at around $450,000. The police could not make significant advances in finding the perpetrator, until they publicly offered a reward of $6000 for each helpful tip. A black shirt with a unique design which was found on one of the crime scenes might have given the critical clue. About a week ago, the police arrested a 37 year old suspect on charges of severe arson. If found guilty, he will face up to 10 years in prison. According to recent reports, experts don't believe that the existing evidence unquestionably points to him."

		text: "Because of a routine check on a cargo vessel, the Indonesian police was able to prevent a smuggling attempt. They found about 150 exotic birds stuffed into plastic drain pipes that were sealed at each end by a wire. The animals were meant to be transported to the US, where they can be sold as pets. Officials assume that the operation was planned and executed by a wildlife trafficking ring. This delivery is worth approximately $250,000. Nearly one week after discovering the illegally captured birds, the police arrested four men who are allegedly responsible for this act. The suspects face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $8000 if found guilty. However, the case rests on an anonymous tip which provides a very weak case and all four suspects still deny any connection to the smuggling affair. Thus, it is still not clear, whether they were involved, or not."

However, the case rests on several eyewitness reports which provide a very strong case and there have been inconsistencies in the testimonies of the four suspects. Thus, it is very likely, that they were involved."
