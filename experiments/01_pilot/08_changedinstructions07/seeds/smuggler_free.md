Because of a routine check on a cargo vessel, the Indonesian police was able to prevent a smuggling attempt. They found about 150 exotic birds stuffed into plastic drain pipes that were sealed at each end by a wire. The animals were meant to be transported to the US, where they can be sold as pets. Officials assume that the operation was planned and executed by a wildlife trafficking ring. This delivery is worth approximately $250,000. Nearly one week after discovering the illegally captured birds, the police arrested four men who are allegedly responsible for this act. The suspects face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $8000 if found guilty. 
However, the case rests on an anonymous tip which provides a very weak case and all four suspects still deny any connection to the smuggling affair. Thus, it is still not clear, whether they were involved, or not.
