"mMLRHJaK0CYrkHG1";1;"Professor Jim Smith, in the Neuroscience Department of Corsen University, was accused of sexual harassment by eleven graduate students. The accusations alleged that he frequently commented on women's appearances, had quid pro quo relations with his students, and held several hot tub parties, involving nudity, that his students were present at. An investigation has been commissioned. The report will include testimony on his character by over a 100 people, and it appears that the situation is more complex and nuanced than the allegations suggest.";"professor_free"

The subject line was ""Important-- please respond"" and said that the person would receive punishment if they didn't pay the fine. The email was traced to a law firm and determined to be a scam. Before the police shut it down, 5% of the people had paid the ""fine."" They trace the email to the internet cafe where the people had sent the email, and used video surveillance to determine it was a man and woman (both 52 years old) who sent the email. They tracked them down, and the 2 people are facing legal action and jail time, especially because the surveillance video is very high quality.";"scam_jail"
