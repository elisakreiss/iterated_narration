On midday on January 1, 2018, a couple returned to their home from a New Year’s Eve party. When they arrived, they found that somebody had forcefully entered, and they immediately contacted the police. When the police officers examined the house, they found a man sleeping at the bottom of the stairs with the stolen goods still in his pockets. He was woken up by the police and tried to escape, but was captured and arrested. His nap probably won’t remain without consequences: The police have initiated criminal proceedings against him for burglary.
