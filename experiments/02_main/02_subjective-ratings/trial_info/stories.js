The hives had been overturned and hacked apart, and the equipment had been thrown out of the shed and smashed. This destruction caused the death of about half a million bees and approximately $60,000 in property damage. Nearly three weeks later, police arrested two boys (12 and 13 years old) who, allegedly, were responsible for the damage. The charges against them include criminal mischief, burglary, and offenses to an agricultural animal facility. Since they are still minors, they will be charged in juvenile court where they face up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $10,000 if convicted. Police officials explained that the investigation is still in progress, and the evidence so far doesn't warrant rushed conclusions about the guilt of the suspects.", chain: "0"},

They found about 150 exotic birds stuffed into plastic drain pipes that were sealed at each end by a wire. The animals were meant to be transported to the US, where they were to be sold as pets. Officials assume that the operation was planned and executed by a wildlife trafficking ring. This delivery would have been worth approximately $250,000. Nearly one week after discovering the illegally captured birds, the police arrested four men who purportedly attempted to commit the smuggling. The suspects face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $8000 if found guilty. The case rests on an anonymous tip, which provides a very weak case for the suspects' guilt. Moreover, all four suspects appear to have plausible alibis. Thus, it seems very unlikely that they were involved.", chain: "0"},

Searching for the email address online leads to an official law firm website located in Barcelona. Shortly after the emails were sent out, the law firm disowned them, calling them a hoax. So far, police officials estimate that approximately 5% of the recipients have paid the money. This sums to more than $17 million that have been paid to the scammers. Now, nearly 4 weeks later, the police have tracked down the internet cafe from which the emails were sent. After observing the cafe's camera footage, the police arrested a man and a woman (both 52) who were allegedly responsible for the scam. If found guilty, they face up to 9 years in prison. However, news outlets recently acquired access to the camera footage and found that the video material is of very poor quality and therefore potentially unreliable.", chain: "0"},
