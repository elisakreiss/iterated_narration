## Experimental Overview

### Pilots
- 01\_psychStudents
	- trying out how current _babe system deals with multiple requests
	- first glance at what we can expect from the data 
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bartlett, bees, flight
	- participants: 75
	- results:
		- detailed analysis in analyses/01\_pilot/01\_psychStudents/readme.md
- 02\_simpleInitMTurk
	- mini pilot to see whether experiment runs on MTurk and submission works
	- participants: 2
- 03\_biggerInitMTurk\_Control
	- first impression of how native speakers on MTurk deal with the task
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bees, flight
	- participants: 25
	- results:
		- identifying interesting effects, especially concerning approximators/ specifiers/ conditionals/ impreciseness
		- detailed analysis in analyses/01\_pilot/03\_biggerInitMTurk\_Control/readme.md
- 04\_biggerInitMTurk\_Lawyer
	- checking whether we see differences to the control condition (same experiment as 03\_biggerInitMTurk\_Control, just with different cover story)
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bees, flight (rather uninteresting)
	- participants: 25
	- results:
		- no effects on first glance compared to control (a few judgments in the end whether they think it would be a good case)
- 05\_biggerInitMTurk\_Party
	- checking whether we see differences to the control condition (same experiment as 03\_biggerInitMTurk\_Control, just with different cover story)
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bees, flight (rather uninteresting)
	- participants: 26
	- results:
		- partially very bizarre stories that have not much to do with initial seed (almost impossible to work with)
- 06\_binEndsMTurk\_Control
	- do we find a different use in hedges when we reassure vs. dispirit the reader's belief that the suspect is in fact responsible?
	- more information regarding the idea and expectations in experiments/01\_pilot/06\_binEndsMTurk\_Control/README.md
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bees (free & jail), smuggler (free & jail), arson (free & jail)
	- participants: 2x30
	- results: 
		- we wanted to manipulate how guilty they see the main character, but they almost always believed they were guilty and that it was just unsure whether they get convicted (especially in bees story; arson worked best)
		- trouble with amount of useful reproductions from Turkers
		- more details in analyses/01\_pilot/06\_binEndsMTurk\_Control/README.md
- **07\_revised06** (current)
	- very similar to pilot 6, but with improved seeds to ensure the right manipulation and with an additional question in the end asking how likely it is that the main character was actually guilty
	- more information regarding the idea and expectations in experiments/01\_pilot/07\_revised06/README.md
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bees (free & jail), smuggler (free & jail), arson (free & jail)
	- participants: prosp. 30


## General thoughts
- change party cover story to "telling your best friend while having dinner" to avoid crazy, exotic and completely untruthful stories
- if there is a difference in 06\_binEndsMTurk\_Control free vs. jail seeds, it would be interesting to see, if a seed without the last sentence rather behaves like a free or a jail seed
