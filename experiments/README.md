## Experimental Overview

### Pilots
- 01\_psychStudents
	- trying out how current _babe system deals with multiple requests
	- first glance at what we can expect from the data 
	- detailed analysis in analyses/01\_pilot/01\_psychStudents/readme.md
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bartlett, bees, flight
	- participants: 75
- 02\_simpleInitMTurk
	- mini pilot to see whether experiment runs on MTurk and submission works
	- participants: 2
- 03\_biggerInitMTurk\_Control
	- first impression of how native speakers on MTurk deal with the task
	- identifying interesting effects, especially concerning approximators/ specifiers/ conditionals/ impreciseness
	- detailed analysis in analyses/01\_pilot/03\_biggerInitMTurk\_Control/readme.md
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bees, flight
	- participants: 25
- 04\_biggerInitMTurk\_Lawyer
	- checking whether we see differences to the control condition (same experiment as 03\_biggerInitMTurk\_Control, just with different cover story)
	- no effects on first glance compared to control (a few judgments in the end whether they think it would be a good case)
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bees, flight (rather uninteresting)
	- participants: 25
- 05\_biggerInitMTurk\_Party
	- checking whether we see differences to the control condition (same experiment as 03\_biggerInitMTurk\_Control, just with different cover story)
	- partially very bizarre stories that have not much to do with initial seed (almost impossible to work with)
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bees, flight (rather uninteresting)
	- participants: 26
- **06\_binEndsMTurk\_Control** (current)
	- do we find a different use in hedges when we reassure vs. dispirit the reader's belief that the suspect is in fact responsible?
	- more information regarding the idea and expectations in experiments/01\_pilot/06\_binEndsMTurk\_Control/README.md
	- cover story: control
	- seeds: bees (free & jail), smuggler (free & jail), arson (free & jail)
	- participants: prosp. 2x30

## General thoughts
- change party cover story to "telling your best friend while having dinner" to avoid crazy, exotic and completely untruthful stories
- if there is a difference in 06\_binEndsMTurk\_Control free vs. jail seeds, it would be interesting to see, if a seed without the last sentence rather behaves like a free or a jail seed
