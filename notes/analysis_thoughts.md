# Analysis Thoughts

## Vagueness

- all dependent on presence/absence of information itself, therefore "given the information survives..."
	- number of changes of approximator presence (introduction/exclusion) *(independent of chains & generations)*
	- number of changes of approximator direction *(independent of chains & generations)*
	- in which generation does originally approximated information lose its approximator

- how many percent of info that used to have an approximator in original seed survive until the end
- how many percent of the approximators survive until the end
- given the information survives, how likely is the presence of an approximator in every generation


## Likelihood

- subjective judgments
	- conduct separate study where we ask "How likely is it in your opinion, that the person/main characters in the story actually committed this crime?" for original seeds and (all or only the final generation?) reproductions
- count number of "if","probably","likely","could",... and whether it's talked about the person's guilt, the prove of guilt or both;
	- how many likelihood/conditional terms survive until the last generation overall?
	- how many likelihood/conditional terms survive until the last generation in which category (person's guilt vs. prove of guilt)?
	- which category survives the most?
	- in which generation does person's guilt/prove of guilt lose its likelihood/conditional terms
