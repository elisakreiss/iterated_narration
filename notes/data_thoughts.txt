Notes

- "arresting" someone generally suggests that this person is also guilty (especially when put in the first sentence)
	- a doubt about that person's guilt seems to be easier elicited when doubt is spreaded in the beginning (before it is talked about "arrest")
- "to prove his guilt" seems to presuppose that he is guilty
